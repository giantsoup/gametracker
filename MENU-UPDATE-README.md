# GameTracker Options Menu Update

## Changes Made

The options menu in the GameTracker dashboard has been updated from a floating menu in the bottom-right corner to a sticky header at the top of the page. This change was made to improve usability and visibility of the menu options.

### Previous Implementation

Previously, the options menu was implemented as a floating menu positioned at the bottom-right corner of the screen. It consisted of two parts:

1. **Display Type Switcher** - Allowed switching between default, projection, and mobile display modes
2. **Layout Switcher** - Allowed switching between three different layout options

While this implementation was functional, it had several drawbacks:
- The buttons were not working when clicked
- The menu was not immediately visible to users
- It could be obscured by other content on the page
- It was not as accessible on mobile devices

### New Implementation

The new implementation moves the options menu to a sticky header at the top of the page. The header includes:

1. **GameTracker Logo/Title** - Provides branding and context
2. **Display Type Switcher** - Same functionality as before, but with improved styling
3. **Layout Switcher** - Same functionality as before, but with improved styling

Benefits of the new implementation:
- Improved visibility - The menu is always visible at the top of the page
- Better accessibility - The menu is easier to access on all devices
- Enhanced usability - The menu is more intuitive and follows common UI patterns
- Responsive design - The menu adapts to different screen sizes
- Consistent styling - The menu uses a cohesive design language

## Technical Implementation

The new sticky header is implemented using Tailwind CSS classes:

- `sticky top-0 z-50` - Makes the header stick to the top of the viewport
- `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 shadow-md` - Provides background color and shadow
- `flex justify-between items-center` - Arranges items horizontally with space between

The buttons maintain the same Livewire `wire:click` directives to ensure the same functionality:
- `wire:click="switchDisplayType('default')"` - Switches to default display mode
- `wire:click="switchDisplayType('projection')"` - Switches to projection display mode
- `wire:click="switchDisplayType('mobile')"` - Switches to mobile display mode
- `wire:click="switchLayout(1)"` - Switches to layout 1
- `wire:click="switchLayout(2)"` - Switches to layout 2
- `wire:click="switchLayout(3)"` - Switches to layout 3

## Responsive Behavior

The header is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes:

- On larger screens, text labels ("Display:" and "Layout:") are shown alongside the buttons
- On smaller screens, only the icons are shown to save space
- Touch targets are appropriately sized for mobile devices
- The header maintains its position at the top of the viewport on all devices

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the options menu could include:

1. Adding a dropdown menu for additional options
2. Implementing keyboard shortcuts for switching layouts and display modes
3. Adding tooltips to provide more information about each option
4. Saving user preferences in local storage or user profiles
5. Adding animation effects for smoother transitions between states
