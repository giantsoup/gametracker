# JavaScript Errors Fix

## Issue
When testing the create event feature, the following JavaScript errors were encountered:

1. `Detected multiple instances of Livewire running`
2. `Detected multiple instances of Alpine running`
3. `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot redefine property: $persist`

## Root Cause
The application was initializing Alpine.js multiple times:

1. In the main `app.js` file, Alpine was being imported and made available to the window object:
   ```javascript
   import { Livewire, Alpine } from '../../vendor/livewire/livewire/dist/livewire.esm';
   // ...
   window.Alpine = Alpine;
   ```

2. The Livewire and/or Flux packages were also initializing Alpine and defining the `$persist` property:
   ```javascript
   Object.defineProperty(Alpine, "$persist", { get: () => persist() });
   ```

When multiple instances of Alpine were running, the `$persist` property was being defined multiple times, causing the error.

## Solution
The solution was to remove the Alpine import and initialization from the `app.js` file, allowing only the Livewire/Flux packages to initialize Alpine:

```javascript
// Before
import { Livewire, Alpine } from '../../vendor/livewire/livewire/dist/livewire.esm';

// Initialize Livewire
Livewire.start();

// Make Alpine available to the window object
window.Alpine = Alpine;
```

```javascript
// After
import { Livewire } from '../../vendor/livewire/livewire/dist/livewire.esm';

// Initialize Livewire
Livewire.start();
```

This change ensures that Alpine is only initialized once, preventing the errors from occurring.

## Best Practices
When working with frameworks like Livewire and Alpine.js, it's important to:

1. Avoid initializing the same library multiple times
2. Be aware of how packages and dependencies initialize libraries
3. Check for conflicts between different versions of libraries
4. Use the initialization methods provided by the frameworks

## Verification
After making this change, the JavaScript errors should no longer occur when testing the create event feature.
