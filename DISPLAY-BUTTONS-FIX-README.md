# GameTracker Display Buttons Fix

## Issue Description

The display type and layout buttons in the GameTracker dashboard were not working correctly. When a user clicked on a button to change the display type or layout, the change was not being applied or was not persisting.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the issue, we identified two main problems:

1. **Query Parameter Handling**: The Dashboard component was not properly handling the `display` query parameter from the URL. It was only checking for the `layout` parameter and the `projection` parameter, but not the `display` parameter that is used by the display type switcher links.

2. **Parameter Preservation**: When switching layouts, the display type preference was not being preserved in the URL. Similarly, when switching display types, the layout preference was not being preserved.

## Solution

We implemented the following changes to fix the issues:

1. **Added Display Parameter Handling**: Updated the `mount` method in the Dashboard component to check for the `display` query parameter and set the `displayType` property accordingly. This ensures that the display type is correctly applied when specified in the URL.

```php
// Check if display type is specified in query parameters
if ($request->has('display')) {
    $display = $request->input('display');
    if (in_array($display, ['default', 'projection', 'mobile'])) {
        $this->displayType = $display;
        
        // Set appropriate default layout for the display type if layout is not specified
        if (! $request->has('layout')) {
            if ($display === 'mobile') {
                $this->activeLayout = 3; // Card grid is more mobile-friendly
            } elseif ($display === 'projection') {
                $this->activeLayout = 1; // Focus layout is better for projection
            }
        }
        
        // Skip auto-detection since display type is explicitly set
        goto skip_detection;
    }
}
```

2. **Preserved Parameters in Links**: Updated the layout switcher links to preserve the display type when switching layouts. This ensures that users don't lose their display type preference when they switch layouts.

```html
<a href="/?layout=1{{ $displayType != 'default' ? '&display='.$displayType : '' }}">
    <!-- Layout 1 button content -->
</a>
```

3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added more detailed logging to help debug any future issues with the display type and layout switching.

```php
// Log the active layout and display type for debugging
\Log::info('Dashboard mounted', [
    'activeLayout' => $this->activeLayout,
    'displayType' => $this->displayType,
    'layout_param' => $request->input('layout'),
    'display_param' => $request->input('display'),
]);
```

## Testing

We tested the changes by:

1. Manually clicking on the display type and layout buttons to verify that they work correctly
2. Checking the URL to ensure that the parameters are being correctly preserved
3. Verifying that the correct display type and layout are applied when the page is loaded with specific query parameters

## Future Recommendations

For future development, we recommend:

1. **Use Query Parameters for UI State**: Continue using query parameters for UI state like display type and layout. This makes it easy to share links with specific configurations and ensures that the state persists across page reloads.

2. **Consistent Parameter Handling**: Ensure that all query parameters are handled consistently in the component's `mount` method. This helps prevent issues where some parameters are recognized but others are not.

3. **Parameter Preservation**: Always preserve all relevant parameters when generating links. This ensures that users don't lose their preferences when navigating between different states.

4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Include all relevant parameters in log messages to make debugging easier. This helps identify issues where parameters are not being correctly processed.

5. **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests for UI state changes to ensure that they continue to work correctly as the codebase evolves.
